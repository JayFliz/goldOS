Beep boop.

Iâ€™m Jon Gold, an inter-disciplinary designer, engineer and cosmic explorer from
London; currently vagabonding around Asia. I work at The Grid building AI design
systems and typography algorithms.

This is my personal corner of the information superhighway. It might be broken!
It might not! Who knows?! Better to be broken than to be boring, I guess. Have a
click around and report any weirds [on
GitHub](https://github.com/jongold/goldOS/issues).

It was built with React, Basscss, Redux, Immutable.js and all of that good
stuff.
