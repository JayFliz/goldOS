<p>Today we’re really excited to share our latest product with you —<br />
<a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>. You can check it out right now, but<br />
first I’d like to tell you a little about why we’ve made it.</p>

<h3 id="startuplife">#startuplife</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago a friend came to me with a problem. The startup she<br />
worked at was imploding—as they do—and she needed to find a new job. She is a<br />
respected designer with a whole bunch of Twitter followers and LinkedIn<br />
connections that she could usually reach out to for leads, but in this case<br />
couldn’t.</p>

<p>When you’re in a full-time job and need to find new work, it’s really<br />
difficult to reach out for help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey guys, I’m looking for work as a visual designer. I’m London based and<br />
can start from Monday”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you tweeted that you’d get fired!</strong> You have to have some tact; unfortunately this usually just means silence. Sneakily emailing your confidants is risky and time consuming; even updating your LinkedIn profile looks suspicious. That network you can usually rely on for favours in a time of need? Gone.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I noticed this recurring trend. <strong>My friends who work<br />
as freelancers would blissfully tweet out their availability</strong>—which I’m more<br />
than happy to pass around—whilst my friends in full-time jobs tip-toed around<br />
and only revealed their career intentions in hushed whispers.</p>

<p>There would be occasional private messages: <em>“Hey, do you know anyone hiring?<br />
Please don’t tweet about it!”</em>, and public tweets saying <em>“My friend is<br />
looking for work”</em>, but that seems like a slow &amp; disjointed way of finding<br />
opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>The web is revolutionising the way we look for work</strong>—and as employers, the way we find talented people to work with—but lots of people are left out of this process.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-help-from-our-friends">A little help from our friends.</h3>

<p>We want everyone to find a job they love and we want to avoid awkward<br />
situations in the job search process. We want to give full-time employees the<br />
same freedom to move around that freelancers enjoy. And we want to make job<br />
searches social.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://makeshift.io/">Makeshift</a>, we started prototyping tools to make<br />
this a thing of the past, which brings us to today.</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*kO6Ge2Ww7wzkvg5G.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Create a profile</strong>. It can be as vague or descriptive as you want. We’ll blur out your name and face!</p>

<p>It’s totally anonymous.</p>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*ZUelPFMk0uYZbILj.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Ask some friends for a helping hand</strong>. They’ll give you an endorsement and—if you ask nicely—share your profile for you.</p>

<p>You know your friend who just wrote a book that everyone is talking about? Ask<br />
her. Or your friend who has a zillion Twitter followers? Ask him! <strong>Get people<br />
talking!</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations from the right people will get employers excited.</p>

<p><strong>Employers get in touch</strong>. This is where you can drop your veil. We’ll filter out the sketchy recruitment agencies, and you can choose who finds out your true identity.</p>

<p>Did your current boss coincidentally get in touch? It’s a small world, but<br />
we’ve got you covered — just reject the message and she’ll be none the wiser.</p>

<p>I’m really excited about <a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>. It has<br />
already helped place people in great companies, and I’d love for you to try it<br />
out.</p>
