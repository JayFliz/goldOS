<h1>On Windows 8</h1>
</header>



<div class="article-content">
<p>This is a post I thought I’d never write. I just installed the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">developer preview</a> of Windows 8 and really like it.</p>

<p>The thing is, Windows 8 is a very impressive operating system. Shockingly good, if you consider the low standard we expect from Microsoft. <strong>Metro is utterly gorgeous</strong>. I fundamentally disagree with Apple’s descent into skeumorphism. I disagree with the principles behind it and the way I see their interfaces going in the next 5-10 years. On the other hand <strong>Metro is fresh and bold</strong>, but most importantly it looks like something one of my favourite designers would have created. <strong>It’s straight out of 1960s Switzerland</strong>, but rather than falling into the trap of being too flat and too rigid an interpretation of 60s Modernism, the whole thing feels clickable, touchable and interactable. It’s a balance I’ve struggled with for as long as I’ve been designing interfaces, so I can appreciate the solution they’ve presented.</p>

<p>It neatly avoids the trap that Apple and Android UIs have fallen into - hinting at depth is fine, but descending into a clusterfuck of of faux-leather textures, glossy buttons and redundant metaphors is taking it too far.</p>

<h3 id="but-wasnt-windows-phone-7-a-bit-shit">But wasn’t Windows Phone 7 a bit shit?</h3>

<p>Yup. I’ve admired Metro for a while, but found it to be too ambitious for a smartphone. It just feels cluttered on a 4” screen. Or maybe it was just badly implemented. <strong>There was a huge disparity from looking at the beautiful screenshots and actually using it.</strong> What does this mean for WP7? That’s not within the scope of this blogpost. On a 10” tablet though, with more room to let the design breathe? <strong>This could be a serious competitor for the ‘lounging on the sofa checking Twitter’ category.</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-about-aero">What about Aero?</h3>

<p>I can appreciate a juggernaut like Microsoft being afraid of alienating users with a rapid change of direction. I don’t like it, but I can appreciate their business goals. I think there will have to be some future iteration of Windows with Aero in it. <strong>But I don’t see the dual-interface thing working out well for them - it presents too many compromises in hardware performance and interface usability</strong>. It shows that Microsoft didn’t learn from a decade of unsellable ‘tablet’ devices. With that said, Aero does look a little nicer than on Windows 7. Perhaps they should release an updated Aero as Windows 7.5.</p>

<h3 id="bi-interfacing--winning">Bi-interfacing ≠ #winning.</h3>

<p>Switching between two interfaces just isn’t going to work. Not for a tablet OS. Click targets and tap targets are too different.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/metro">Gruber made an interesting point the other day</a> - perhaps on desktop you’ll have both Metro and Aero; on tablet devices just Metro. That would be fantastic. I wouldn’t use a desktop version of Windows any time soon, but in the event that they really nailed the tablet ecosystem I could see myself trading my iPad for a Windows tablet for casual use.</p>

<p>If they get rid of Aero on tablets they’ll have a shot at producing cheap, light tablets with modest hardware and excellent battery life.</p>

<h3 id="so-you-think-microsoft-is-going-to-whoop-apples-ass">So you think Microsoft is going to whoop Apple’s ass?</h3>

<p>Nope. My spidey-sense is telling me <strong>Microsoft is organisationally incapable of doing anything exceptional</strong>. They’ve hired some fantastic designers but I just don’t see them working as a team to create a great product. The design teams are only a tiny blip in MSFT’s organisational structure, and there are too many potential conflicts of interest that will prevent them from creating a beautiful and pure OS. <strong>Godforbid they make a Metro-style Ribbon…</strong></p>

<p>The other reason is fragmentation. Without a full-stack offering to compete with Apple (or soon, Google-Motorola) it will still be Windowsy. <strong>Things will still break</strong>. Asian OEMs will still release shitty hardware, and that shitty hardware will work like shit with Windows 8.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget why we made (and enjoyed) the switch to Macs -** it wasn’t that OS9/X was prettier than Windows** (arguably the first few iterations of OSX were ugly as sin compared to the more restrained XP) - <strong>it was that Macs just worked</strong>, and we were sick of .dll files, registry entries and things breaking on PCs.</p>

<p><strong>And that’s the most important thing Apple still has going for it, because they can’t rely on their interfaces any more.</strong></p>

<p>—</p>

<p>If you have Windows 8 installed I’d love to know your thoughts in the comments!</p>
